# Open-access-data-driven-retrofit-evaluation
A space for open access tools for data-driven retrofit evaluation and opportunity for contribution

Welcome!

Thank you for visiting my project page.

I have just set this up so please let me know if you notice gaps in information you expect to see.
This document (README) aims to provide all you need to know for a project overview. Please use the links below or read in full if you prefer.

*The challenge and motivation
Buildings account for around 40% of global CO2 emissions and the UK housing sector accounts for around a third of UK emissions. We can reduce this using decarbonisation retrofit via a range of technologies to increase efficiency of the building fabric, heat and power. The best way to learn what works well with housing adaptation is to evaluate what has been installed before and share this information, where ethical to do so.

*What am I doing in this project and why am I doing it?
This project aims to develop an open source protocol for retrofit evaluation, providing the data collection and analysis frameworks to apply to data that can then be shared. This will be available openly in Github via this website. 

I hope this will serve as a place to access information easly and guide early career researchers or practitioners and householders. I am keen to move towards a citizen science approach with this.

The problem I am working to address is that retrofit evaluation and data collection methods vary. This presents a challenge when trying to learn from previous data stemming from case study projects, which offer the greatest potential for evaluation.

*What is unique about this?
This will become a unique portal for retrofit evaluation method and data sharing. This can allow a robust method to be co-created, adapted and shared with the research community and beyond. This can form the basis of a citizen science project.

*Who am I?
I am a post-doctoral researcher working on data-driven retrofit decision-making and based at Imperial College London and the Alan Turing Institute.
