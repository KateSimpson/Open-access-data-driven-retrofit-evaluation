## Welcome to my new website!

I hope to use this to encourage open discussion and collaboration towards open retrofit evaluation data.

Here is my first share, a sort of catalogue of various data others have colected, that could inform retrofit. Please suggest more!

- **REFIT** 20 core homes	Academic	Survey data	Gas consumption, electrical load measurements, internal air temperature, local climate data and sensor measurements	One survey (1,054 households), Semi-structured interviews and one structured survey on perceptions of smart homes	https://www.refitsmarthomes.org/datasets/

- **Mixed data on household energy and occupant behaviour	LEEDR**: 20 households: building survey data, images, appliances, sensor location and calibration	Window and door opening, electrical power measurement of incoming supply and appliances, gas and hot water consumption	Window and door opening, Passive Infra-Red room activity monitoring, 
Data processing procedures for all data.	https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/LEEDR_project_home_energy_dataset/6176450

- **National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework	NEED** UK wide	Government	Building attribute data (from Valuation Office Agency and Scottish Assessor)	Matches gas and electricity data (from Energy suppliers and transporters) with energy efficiency measures installed (from HEED and policy measures)	Household characteristics (from Experian) and socio-demographics (Government data)	Government-led overview. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-energy-efficiency-data-need-framework

- **Home Energy Efficiency Data	HEED** UK wide	Government	Property characteristic and insulation measures installed	Heating systems and micro-generations installed	--	Universities, Government and non-profit organisations can access, but not householders	https://localhomesportal.est.org.uk/

- **Gas consumption data**	Postcode level across UK	Government	postcode	Gas consumption	-	Compare EPC and gas use data at postcode level	https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/postcode-level-gas-statistics-2018-experimental

- **Energy Performance Certificate** data	Individual property level: UK wide	Government	Archetype, fabric construction	Heating system and micro-generations installed, estimates of gas and electricity use derived from BREDEM methodology	https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/

- **English Housing Survey (50 years of data)**	Housing circumstance, condition, energy efficiency	Government	Physical attributes 	Energy efficiency	Household circumstance	Data could be used to inform ‘property passport’ data via the Trustmark data warehouse (below)	https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/50-years-of-the-english-housing-survey

- **Retrofit for The Future** an Innovate UK project for 100 social homes	Low Energy Building Database: case studies across UK 	Non-Government organisation	Photographs (archetype, geometry, materials and age).	Energy use, air-tightness, indoor temperature, for some	householder perception and experience.	https://www.lowenergybuildings.org.uk/

- **Data warehouse on retrofit and social network**	Trustmark	Government led organisation	Property passport data, measures installed	Data required under PAS 2035	Installer compliance, supply chain overview, organisations and consumers can become early adopters	https://www.trustmark.org.uk/ourservices/data-warehouse

- **A list of data on energy consumption, fuel poverty and 	Open Data Collaboration Initiative**, CSE	Non-Government Organisation	Links to Government shared data on energy consumption, efficiency and census 	All focused around energy consumption and efficiency	Fuel poverty data	Data can be accessed shared and discussed with CSE	https://www.cse.org.uk/projects/view/1259
