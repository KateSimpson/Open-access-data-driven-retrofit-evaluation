Here is my first share, a sort of catalogue of various data that could inform retrofit. Please suggest more!

- [**REFIT**](https://www.refitsmarthomes.org/datasets/) 20 core homes	Academic	Survey data	Gas consumption, electrical load measurements, internal air temperature, local climate data and sensor measurements	One survey (1,054 households), Semi-structured interviews and one structured survey on perceptions of smart homes	

- [**Mixed data on household energy and occupant behaviour	LEEDR**](https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/LEEDR_project_home_energy_dataset/6176450) 20 households: building survey data, images, appliances, sensor location and calibration	Window and door opening, electrical power measurement of incoming supply and appliances, gas and hot water consumption	Window and door opening, Passive Infra-Red room activity monitoring, data processing procedures for all data
